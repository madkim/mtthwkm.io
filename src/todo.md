Tell me a little about yourself
Hi (wave) I’m so glad you made it. Here’s a little more info about me! My name is Matthew Kim and I was born and raised in Redlands California.

In 2017 I graduated from the University of California Santa Cruz with a bachelors degree in Computer Science.

For work I build web applications and websites (like this one!) in Javascript and React.js. I love design and making things feel good! There’s a joy in taking an idea and molding it into something real that people can use and interact with. Often times I find myself thinking of little things. For better or worse, small details add up and whether or not others explicitly notice, they will feel it.

In my free time you can find me enjoying the great outdoors. I’m an avid music listener, coffee drinker, art appreciator, and rock climber. My favorite color is orange and I’m a father of 2 cats and a dog, all of which I love equally in their own way.

Tell me your life story
Hi (wave) I’m so glad you made it. Here’s a lot more info about me. My name is Matthew Kim and I was born and raised in Redlands California.

Growing up I always found myself comfortable with computers. My grandparents use to tell me as a child I always knew what to do when it came to helping them troubleshoot issues (much like most grandkids!). I suppose I never thought much about it but thinking back it probably did affect me pursuing a career in computer science.

A big part of getting into computers came from video games. As a kid, I was blessed with a Super Nintendo which altered my life forever. I remember spending hours playing games like Legend of Zelda, Street Fighter and Contra. Eventually I upgraded to a PS2 and ultimately ended up playing a lot of computer games. All this informed my love of computers and the virtual worlds that could be explored within them.

As it was time to go off to college I got my first MacBook. I had played piano since I was a child and picked up drums throughout high-school, yet I think my real musical journey started with my first MacBook. I taught myself the music software Logic and Ableton and ever since then I’ve enjoyed producing music in my spare time.

In my first year of college, I remember not knowing what to do and being quite confused. I had a good friend who was taking an intro computer science course and seeing him write code which was immediately output to the screen was something that peaked my interest. The following quarter I enrolled in the intro to java course and the rest was history.

After graduating I spent some time soul searching and trying to find what I wanted to do. Being a new grad was scary and definitely challenged me. I found myself in an intense bout of imposter syndrome, something I didn’t fully understand until I experiencing it. Luckily it just takes one person to give you a chance. In 2018 I worked at a small research facility that needed a full-stack developer to take over a project which handled patient records (similar to the EPIC system but much smaller scale). I gained insight into the inner workings of how a web application works from front to back. I owe a lot to being able to have that opportunity and enjoyed the position very much.

As with all things, at some point, they must come to an end. At the end of 2019 the facility I worked for was absorbed. It took a lot of thinking but I decided it was time for me to move on to bigger and better things! I finished my work, packed my bags and moved up to Sacramento, CA to live with my long time partner. During this time I picked up some odd jobs here and there, from helping a family friend with a website to working at a rock climbing gym. All of which came to a halt when the pandemic hit.

I spent most of the pandemic isolating and feeling isolated. It was scary and is still something that we are dealing with in our day to day. In July of 2020, I became very sick with anemia. I moved back home to Redlands, CA where I spent much of the remainder of the year recovering. It has been a difficult road to recovery, thankfully as of late I am fully recovered and healthy. With all the life changes that 2020 brought, not all were negative. Nov 2020, on Thanksgiving, I received an offer of employment for AxS Health, a telemedicine start up that I had been interested in since around the time I graduated.

Working for AxS Health, I’ve been able to hone my skills in front end development.

  - AxS
    Our platform offers digital patient registration, telemedicine, and patient communication solutions, enabling practices to improve access and deliver care simply.
    The difficulties healthcare presents to the US public are only increasing.  However, only now do we live in an environment that is capable of welcoming solutions to those difficulties.  We’ve entered an era where medical opinion, technologies and public demand have all come together to accept these changes and create a tool that can actually make a difference in the way patients interact with the healthcare system.  

    We, and others like us, are recognizing this environment and creating tools that patients can leverage, making each participant a change-maker in their own right.  We just happen to do it better.

    AxS Health has developed a healthcare software platform that gives patients priority access to in-person doctor visits as well as convenient, in-app telemedicine treatment for simple conditions. Combining these elements makes AxS the only truly comprehensive offering for digital healthcare access for Cash, PPO, and High Deductible Health Plan holding patients. 

    Check out the AxS Health App in the iTunes App Store and the Google Play Store to step into the future of healthcare delivery.
